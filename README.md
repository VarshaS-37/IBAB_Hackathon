# IBAB_Hackathon 🔍
Participated in the ML for Protein Engineering hackathon organized by IBAB x Locksmith Bio

Team Name: ALPHA_BENDERS

Team Mate: [Sandhya](https://github.com/Sandhyae2)

### Challenge 1
Redesign the heavy-chain CDR loops (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, CDR-H3) to create a
novel antibody that maintains or improves binding to PD-1 while demonstrating significant
sequence novelty.

### Challenge 2
Design a complete VH/VL antibody de novo that binds PD-1. You may target the
same epitope as pembrolizumab, a different epitope, or design multi-epitope approaches.
